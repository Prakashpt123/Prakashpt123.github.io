        But what exactly does it entail? Self motivation affects everything you do in life, 
        from waking up early in the morning to complete your daily tasks, to studying hard 
        for that upcoming exam, to working out at the gym when you are tired and just want to 
        chill on the couch with a bag of chips. Self motivation is what makes you accomplish your
         goals and reach your full potential as a human being, and with it we can truly be unstoppable!
