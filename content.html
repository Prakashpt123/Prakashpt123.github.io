                <h2>How to Stay Self Motivated:</h2>
            </header>
               <p>
                So how do we give ourselves that necessary push to motivate ourselves? 
                Here are some tips on how you can become more self motivated:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Wake up early. Like, as early as 5 am if you can manage it (or even 
                earlier if you’re really hardcore). 
                There’s a reason why all successful people seem to be early risers.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Plan your day the night before, and write it on a note on your wall, 
                on your desktop background, or in some other place you will see everyday. A day planner also 
                works very well if it is the kind that you carry
                 around with you to remind yourself of what you should be doing at any given time.</p>
              <p>
                3. Make a schedule for yourself, and include all the tasks you need to accomplish for that day.
                 This will make it easier to do everything on time, 
                without forgetting anything, and will keep you on track with your goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Take small steps to success. You don’t have to wake up early and immediately 
                start running 10 kilometers. Just get up, have a shower and breakfast, and start
                 studying or working out.
                 Once you get used toit you will be able to do it without even thinking about it.
              </p>   
              <p>
                5. Once you start feeling tired or lazy, try doing some exercise or stretching. 
                This will get your blood going and you’ll feel energized after that. Also, drinking a lot of
                 water throughout the day will keep you hydrated and feeling good.
              </p>
              <p>
                6. Remember: A new day will always begin after just one night! So don’t feel bad 
                about the things you didn’t accomplish yesterday,
                 because there’s always a chance to start all over again.
              </p>
              <p>
                7. Make your goals SMART. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, 
                and Time-bound goals will make it easier to stay motivated. For example, instead of saying 
                “I will go to the gym three times a week”, saying “I will go to the gym every day from Monday 
                through Friday at 5 pm”  will make your goals more specific and measurable.
              </p>
              <p>
                8. Find a workout buddy. Someone who is going to be able to push you to do your best 
                and motivate you if you happen to slack off.
              </p>
              <p>
                9. Listen to music while at the gym, cooking, studying or doing homework.
                 Or watching a movie if you’re procrastinating on your studies. Music has 
                the power to change our mood and can motivate us immensely!
              </p>
              <p>
                10. Treat yourself, but in moderation. Buy yourself a new top if you’ve been good this week 
                and have met your goals, or if you’re having a good day, but don’t reward yourself 
                with that expensive ice cream or chocolate cake if you’ve been slacking off.
                 Treating yourself is a good 
                incentive to stay motivated, but don’t let it become too much of a crutch.
